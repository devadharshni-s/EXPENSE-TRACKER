**Expense Tracker (Python + SQL)**
A simple project to track daily spending.

This is a small project I built to practice Python and SQL. It helps you record your daily expenses and understand where your money is going.
You can add expenses, view them, and check your total spending. Everything is saved in a small database so you can access it anytime.


**What this project can do**
-Add an expense (amount, category, date, note)
-See all your expenses listed
-Calculate the total money spent
-Check how much you spent in each category (Food, Travel, etc.)
-View expenses for a particular month


**How I built it**
I used:
-Python to handle the logic
-SQLite to store the expenses
-Simple functions to interact with the database

The entire project is beginner-friendly and easy to understand.


**How to run it**
Just run the Python file:
    python expense_tracker.py


**SQL Queries Used**
-CREATE TABLE 
-INSERT 
-SELECT 
-SUM()
-LIKE for monthly filtering 



**Why I built this**
I wanted to create a small, real-life project to practice:
-Python programming
-SQL queries
-Database handling
-Problem-solving
It helped me understand how applications store and manage data.


**Future improvements**
I may add:
-A simple UI
-Export to CSV
-Category-wise charts
-A login system
